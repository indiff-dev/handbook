The Mission defines the fundamental "reason for existence" of a business or product. It is often expressed in the present tense, serving as a guiding principle for decision-making and a foundation for the values that drive what the company aims to deliver to its customers, society, and team members today.

## Our Mission

Why do we exist today?

> Our mission is to **"promote a community-driven, co-creative development approach where developers and users become one unified team."**

We aim to transform the conventional relationship where development teams simply deliver products and users merely consume them, into one where both sides co-create meaningful products together. Our goal is to support many development teams in closing the gap with their users, empowering them to create products that users genuinely find useful, innovative, and delightful.
