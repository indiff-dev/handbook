Humans are inherently imperfect and prone to laziness.

It is incredibly challenging to maintain unwavering commitment to a decision over the long term.

Our work in this organization is much like **"laying bricks."** If you lay each brick carefully and deliberately, you can build a towering structure that reaches the sky. But if you lay them carelessly, the tower will either collapse or reach a point where it can no longer be built higher.

**This page defines the attitudes, principles, and philosophies that shape our organizational culture. These values must be upheld without compromise, forming the foundation of everything we do.**

If you ever encounter someone acting against this culture, anyone in this organization – regardless of rank or position – is encouraged to deliver the following message:

> **"That goes against our culture. It is unacceptable."**

We strongly encourage this kind of direct feedback. **We will celebrate those who preserve our culture and those who act to stop its erosion.**

## "What Must Never Change" vs. "What Can Be Changed"

To clearly define our culture, we will distinguish between **"What Must Never Change"** and **"What Can Be Changed"** within this organization.

We invite you to exercise your creativity and autonomy in areas that can be changed, while we ask for your unwavering commitment to those things that must never be compromised.

## What Must Never Change

### 1. When it comes to decisions that impact the value provided to our customers or the quality of their experience, we must act with thorough consideration, careful execution, and a clear strategy. If it isn't something that everyone can confidently say is "undeniably good," it is unacceptable.

We are not asking for perfection in every task.

However, when it comes to matters that directly impact customer value and experience, we expect nothing less than the highest standards of thought and craftsmanship. Decisions in this domain must be beyond doubt, reflecting a commitment to excellence that anyone in the organization can stand behind with confidence.

### Request for Help in Building Organizational Culture

> Alice: I'd like to ask you, Bob, to help lay the foundation of our organizational culture. Could you assist with this?

> Bob: Sure, I think we should just replicate what GitLab has done. Their culture is great, and we could just copy-paste what they've written in their Handbook.

> Alice: That goes against our culture. It is unacceptable.
> We need to find our own way – a way that truly fits our organization. I don’t believe we can build the best possible culture by simply copying someone else’s practices.
>
> Can you honestly say that this approach will lead to building an undeniably great organization?
> For example, I’m thinking of something like this Culture page. What do you think, Bob?
